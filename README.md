# Opus
Opus is a feature for dating apps that allows people to match through creative expression, created for HvA CMD course Project: Tech. Opus allows users to toggle to a version of the dating app where users can upload their own or their favourite artwork instead of selfies, allowing users to find new matches through mutual creative interests.
